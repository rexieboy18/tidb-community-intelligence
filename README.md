```

## 🎯 Product Vision

### The Problem
- **Manual Support Burden**: 40% of support tickets are repetitive
- **Slow Onboarding**: New developers take 2-3 days to get productive
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Community wisdom scattered across platforms
- **No Predictive Insights**: Issues only addressed after they occur

### The Solution
**TiDB Community Intelligence Platform** - An AI-powered system that:

1. **Instantly matches** user problems with community solutions
2. **Predicts and prevents** common issues before they happen
3. **Personalizes guidance** based on developer's tech stack
4. **Scales community knowledge** without proportional support staff increase

### Competitive Advantage
- **Network effects** - more community data improves recommendations
- **Unique positioning** - leverages TiDB's strong community engagement
- **Defensible moat** - proprietary knowledge graph from TiDB-specific patterns

## 📈 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- ✅ Real-time community data ingestion
- ✅ Basic AI similarity matching
- ✅ Web interface prototype
- 🎯 **Target**: 80% search accuracy, 50% faster onboarding

### Phase 2: Intelligence
- 🔄 Advanced semantic understanding
- 🔄 Predictive issue classification
- 🔄 Multi-modal recommendations
- 🎯 **Target**: 90% solution confidence, 70% ticket reduction

### Phase 3: Scale
- 📅 Enterprise API platform
- 📅 Global deployment
- 📅 Partner ecosystem integrations
- 🎯 **Target**: 95% automation rate, 2x community growth
