        ## 👋 Hello PingCAP Hiring Team!
        
        I've created this working demonstration specifically for the **Senior Product Manager - Developer Experience** position.
        
        ### 🎯 What This Demo Showcases
        
        This isn't just a concept - it's a **fully functional platform** that demonstrates how TiDB's incredible community engagement (37,000+ GitHub stars) could be transformed into an AI-powered developer experience platform.
        
        **Key Capabilities Demonstrated:**
        - 🔍 **AI-Powered Issue Search** - Semantic matching of developer problems with community solutions
        - 🛠️ **Tech Stack Intelligence** - Personalized recommendations based on developer's technology ecosystem  
        - 📊 **Community Analytics** - Real-time insights from TiDB's GitHub activity
        - 🚀 **Strategic Business Case** - Complete implementation roadmap with ROI analysis
        
        ### 💡 Why This Matters for PingCAP
        
        This demo shows my ability to:
        - **Think strategically** about developer experience challenges
        - **Execute technically** - this is real code pulling live TiDB data
        - **Bridge business and technical needs** - from AI implementation to business case

    ## 💬 A Personal Note
    
    I built this demo because I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to transform TiDB's developer experience. 
    
    My background in **technical product management** at Starbucks taught me how to take complex technical platforms and make them accessible to users. I reduced integration complexity from 3 months to 3 weeks by focusing on self-service capabilities and intuitive design - exactly the kind of thinking that could benefit TiDB's developer community.
    
    This demo represents my **product vision, technical execution ability, and strategic thinking** - the core skills needed for this role.
    
    **I'd love to discuss how we can make this vision a reality at PingCAP!**
